I am looking for motivated graduate students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in microbial ecology and evolution. Students interested in my lab may apply either to the <a href= "http://www.bio.indiana.edu/graduate/eeb/"> Evolution, Ecology, & Behavior Program</a>  or the <a href="http://www.bio.indiana.edu/graduate/micro/"> Microbiology Program</a>, both of which are in the <a href="http://www.bio.indiana.edu/">  Department of Biology</a>. The application deadline is December 1. Students are funded through a combination of research grants, teaching assistantships, and university fellowships. Interested graduate students should send a email letter of inquiry containing an overview of your research interests, your CV, grades, and GRE scores (if available).

I currently have funding for a postdoc in my lab. In addition, I have interdisciplinary grants submitted that would fund postdocs to work on topics related to the ecology and evolutionary biology of microbial communities. Please contact me if you are interested.
