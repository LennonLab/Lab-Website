    <h5>Microbial seed banks </h5>
    <p>
In nature, environmental conditions are often suboptimal for growth and reproduction. Thus, organisms must be able to survive long periods of stress and resource limitation, rendering longevity a key life-history trait for many organisms, including microorganisms. One strategy highlighted in our labâ€™s research is dormancy, a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity. Dormancy leads to the accumulation of genetic, phenotypic, and taxonomic diversity stored in seed banks. We study the evolution and ecology of microbial dormancy, longevity, and the related phenomenon of aging. We use laboratory evolution experiments, simulation modeling, and molecular tools to better understand how these life-history traits structure microbial communities in natural, engineered, and host-associated ecosystems.

    <h5>Eco-evolutionary dynamics </h5>
    <p>
Owing to their large population sizes and short generation times, microorganisms have the capacity to evolve on contemporary time scales. This high rate of population turnover can be exploited to examine evolutionary dynamics that would take thousands to millions of years to occur in plant and animal systems, allowing us to answer fundamental questions about the nature of evolution. In our lab, we examine how microorganisms evolve and adapt in an ecologically relevant context by replicating the environmental conditions microorganisms frequently encounter in nature. Through a combination modeling, experimental evolution, genomics, high-throughput trait and fitness measurements, we quantify the rate and direction of evolution and coevolution across a range of environments.

    <h5>Microbial community ecology and biodiversity </h5>
    <p>
Microorganisms exhibit remarkably high biodiversity at the global scale and are assembled into taxonomically diverse communities across a range of ecosystems. Our lab studies the processes and constraints that underlie patterns of diversity across space and time. We study how factors such as resources, habitat complexity, and residence time interact with ecological processes (e.g., dispersal and dormancy) to influence microbial community structure across space and time. Using observations and experiments from the laboratory and field, a variety of simulation modeling techniques, and macroecological syntheses of global-scale biodiversity data, we evaluate a broad range of theoretically motivated questions about the mechanisms that regulate microbial systems.

    <h5>Microbial Traits</h5>
    <p>
 Traits refer to the physiological, morphological, and behavioral characteristics that influence the fitness or performance of individuals under a given set of environmental conditions. In microbial systems, the interplay of individual traits leads to the emergence of population-, community, and ecosystem-level phenomena. Our lab has explores important microbial traits including resource use, enzyme capacity, biofilm production, phage resistance, and stress tolerance. Although traits have historically been difficult to study for microbes, our lab investigates microbial traits using phylogenetic comparative methods, field sampling, wet lab experiments, and computational methods to understand how contemporary and deeply conserved traits evolve, shift along environmental gradients, structure communities, and influence ecosystem processes.
